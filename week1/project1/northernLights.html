        <em>THE OTHERWORLDLY AURORA borealis</em>, or northern lights, begin high in the Earth's atmosphere-at altitudes from 60
        to more than 250 miles-when charged particles from the sun become traped in the Earth's magnetic field. The
        result is a colorful, dancing light show.

        The first time I filmed an aurora ws from an icebreaker near Antartica. Luckily, there are much more accessible
        places if you'd like to take in these light shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial
        scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55' and low light pollution. Find
        your magnetic lattitude on NOAA and here.

    <p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear on any dark night. Long winter nights are good
        but not neccessarily the best time. Nea equinoxes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic
        field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora seasons!
        I suggest autumnal equinox in September, when there are pleasant temperatueres in polar latitudes
        Find the dark hours of your location here, or by using a sky guide app.
