    <h1>Iceland</h1>
    <p>
        <strong><em>Iceland</em></strong> is a country of sharp contrasts. A place where fire and ice co-exist. 
        Where dark winters are offset by the summer's midnight sun. A country
        where insular existence has spurred a rich and vibrant culture.

            <p>
                The Aurora Borealis takes its name from the Roman goddess of dawn, Aurora and the Greek
                name for the north wind. Boreas. From September to April, Iceland is a hotspot for this
                magnificent lightshow <br>
                The Aurora Borealis, more commonly refered to as the Northern Lights is a natural phenomenon
                created when particles emitted bu the sun interact with the Earth's magnetic. This releases 
                energy, causing peculiar luminous green streaks across the skies.

                When making a trip to Iceland, it is hard not to pay spcial attention to the country's 
                namesake-namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is
                practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the <span>S&oacutelheimaj&otilderkull</span> and <span>Svinafekksj&otildekull</span> 
                glaciers in the south of Iceland, to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik (and Skaftafell).
